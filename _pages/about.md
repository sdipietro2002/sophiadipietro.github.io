Hi! I’m **Sophia DiPietro**, a graduate researcher at the University of Miami’s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science (RSMAS).  

In 2024, I graduated from Barnard College of Columbia University with a degree in Environmental Science and Sustainability, and was a member of  Columbia-Barnard Women's Rowing team. My research interests include climate science, hazard mitigation, and extreme events. I enjoy working at the intersection of science and policy, and have experience with public outreach. I can be contacted by email at sophia.dipietro@earth.miami.edu
